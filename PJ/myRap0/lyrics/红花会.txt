Better Now-红花会
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benz oh
You're not even speaking to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were looking forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it’s gonna take
Another foreign or a bigger chain
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh
I promise
I swear to you I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (love of my life)
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh


in my chillin-红花会
8 piece
With the grape drink
On the side it's
Fried hard with the mutha****in' fries, bitch
(Aye, did the J-Kwon vocals come in yet, bruh?)
JD, do you love Smi?
Are you riding?
That Suzuki love, ain't doing no motorcycling
I'm like, "Hol' up"
Need some roll up
Like I'm big worm pull up in the ice cream
Go to my ends
Where it begins
Get a signal like the wifi get you loudin'
'Fore you slide in
I'm a fat kid
Throw the cake and licky lick off all the icing
I gotta change
I got a chain
Diamonds very Venus VVS
Tennis necklace stank
And they dance like Tina Turner
Heard my name been ringing a bell
Made it sing like Patti LaBelle
Lose her voice like shawty Adele
She want that computer love
I said, 'Bitch, go get you a Dell'
I'm a MAC, I'm a pro
In Wisconsin, I'm at the Dells
She feel like she Earnhardt
Crashin' out
I'm feelin' like Dale
All we do is burn spark
Conversations turn into dust
Now we used to, hold on
Trap Money Smino (Hello)
I buy you Valentino
Pop you like some Pringles
Deeper than a sea, guhl
Flew in like a seagull
Once you get a Mike, can't never **** a Tito
Do you love Smi?
Is you riding?
Used to being alone
Can I borrow some time and
Come and find me
Northside and
'Cause I move that 'caine like he Ron, no Isley
No advisin'
Ain't no guidin'
Gotta get it
And it's only 'bout providing

Won't be no truce, won't be no truce
At your funeral in an all black suit
Couple white girls rocking all black too
Million man march in the all black boots
Call up the troops, call up the troops
Punch you in the mouth, then knock out your tooth

Talkin' that ***********t, ********** what you gon' do
What you gon' do? What you gon' do?
Back and I'm black and I'm acting brand new
**********s in the back like, "Oh word"
Diamonds all black like, "********** what ya heard"
********** what ya heard, ********** what ya heard
Spillin' some Hennessy Black on the curb
This for the memory of the deceased
When I black out, I awaken the beast
What it's gon' be? What it's gon' be?
You don't wanna ********** with a ********** like me

Four hundred years of oppression
I'm about to get me that black Tesla
Black Skid marks on the pavement
Cops wanna see me in a black cage
Black on black on black
Master Juba with the tap dance
Gucci with the Dapper Dan
Tell 'em, "Kiss my black ass"
Ridin' on the dyno with black mags
Just another black man tryin' stay up out the casket
Black don't crack

I gotta go to Ancestry.com
I think I'm 'bout to black
All the police ain't about the black
He still a pig even though he black
Willie got a lynch head in that
If you black you dead in that
Strange fruit hang from a tree
On the leaves is rad and that
Do it right like a Garveyite
Africa, I'm heading back
**********s in the street black on black
Kill him with the heat (Blat, blat, blat)
Cut off his feet (put em in the shackle)
Mansa Musa been had the cash
Mix blacks to dilute blacks
Don't want blacks to produce blacks
Take black and they boot that
Orange is the new black
Black, black, black
Black on black
Black my thoughts so black
Black, black on black
My skin is so black, I'm rocking that black on black
It's black
Black rims on these black wheels

Night Calls-红花会
When I call you late at night
I'm not tryna' conversate
You know I only got a single thing in mind
I don't even gotta say it
When I call you late at night
I'm not tryna' conversate, no
You Gotta drop your panties, waste no time
Always hard for you to say no
The way I sex you girl, makes you wanna date
I'ma pull up on your block just to hit it babe
And I'm a dog, might just lick it like a dinner plate
Ain't no talkin' I need you now
I could never fall in love
That's what I was tryna' tell you
Now you feel like enough is enough
You think I want you for your body
I play games, call you when I need somebody
I say things I know you won't tell nobody
I know your heart and your soul
All the things niggas don't know
I was there before your glow
But lately I've been on the go
Studio all day, with Kalim all day
Penning hits all day, I can not be your bae
There's so many times you tried to shut me down
I'm wasting your time
But still I take you down
I smoke and I drink girl now I'm just being myself

When I call you late at night
I'm not tryna' conversate
You know I only got a single thing in mind

You Gotta drop your panties, waste no time
Always hard for you to say no
The way I sex you girl, makes you wanna date
I'ma pull up on your block just to hit it babe
And I'm a dog, might just lick it like a dinner plate
Ain't no talkin' I need you now

Never let my own feelings control me
She's got a man but I keep scorin'
Keep doing you babe
Keep fooling yourself, girl
Now shawty **** me through another man
Posting pictures with him on the gram
She be tryna' make me jealous
'Cause I won't tell her I got feelings
I text her like I'm on the way
I'm toasted I don't wanna' wait
And then she reply she's in love with the pipe
But she hates that I don't wanna date
When I call you late at night
I'm not tryna' conversate
You know I only got a single thing in mind
I don't even gotta say it
When I call you late at night
I'm not tryna' conversate, no
You Gotta drop your panties, waste no time
Always hard for you to say no
The way I sex you girl, makes you wanna date
I'ma pull up on your block just to hit it babe
And I'm a dog, might just lick it like a dinner plate
Ain't no talkin' I need you now

Blowback-红花会
We've been divided by an ocean
Had a hundred things in motion
Said you barely recognize me

Yeah,I've been gone for quite a while
But can we just reconcile
No,I never meant to leave you

I was busy but I promise you the next time
You won't feel like I forgot about you

I know it's a fault but just remember
I'll be back home in November
I won't miss you 'til I see the smoke

Call it blowback,call it blowback
Call it blowback,call it blowback
Call it blowback,call it blowback
Call it blowback,call it blowback

Ooh,it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo bop,shoo bop,my baby
Ooh,it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo bop,shoo bop,my baby
Ooh,it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo bop,shoo bop,my baby
Ooh,it seems like a mighty long time

Your mind would disagree I could tell
When you smile does it let you wish me well
Bore a cyclone every time you exhale
I cut off the ground and now I'm unbounded
But miss you around it
That's why you should come and
Sit me all about the mountains
You used to kiss me like your lips
Have caught fire,but no ties
That smoke gets my eyes

Blowback,call it blowback
Call it blowback,call it blowback
Call it blowback,call it blowback
Call it blowback,call it blowback

Ooh,it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo bop,shoo bop,my baby
Ooh,it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo bop,shoo bop,my baby
Ooh,it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo bop,shoo bop,my baby
Ooh,it seems like a mighty long time

Hello stranger
It seems so good to see you back again
How long has it been

Ooh,it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo bop,shoo bop,my baby
Ooh,it seems like a mighty long time
Shoo bop,shoo bop,my baby
Ooh,it seems like a mighty long time

Yeah
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane
Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
Hermès link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'mma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his guts, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I **** yo bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo hoe if yo bitch keep eyein' me

I'ma explain why you probably never seen me
I'm in a sunken place, no Instagram, I'm watchin' TV
I think I trade my breakfast, lunch and dinner for some kitty
Please believe me, I see RiRi, I'ma eat it like panini
I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy
I go crazy in my Yeezy, Kirk Kneezy on the beat
I told 'em now we finna glow up in the street
Rappers talk subliminal but they don't talk to me
Put 'em in a Jersey shore like Pauly D
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

Nowadays-红花会
CashMoneyAP
Aye, aye, aye
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we ******' break a sin
Nowadays *******t's not the same
Life switch lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so
Aye, it's so lonely on the east side
I don't give a ******, I keep it real I'm not gon' let it slide
Now she see me up, she let me ******
Want me to come inside?
Broski going dumb, hopped in the car, he said he down to ride
You a little pup, stop playing tough, ain't make no sacrifice
Yeah, smokin' cookie for my appetite
I don't trust nobody, people talking and be telling lies
We just wanna win and shock them all and catch 'em by surprise
I was saucin' down until we up and then we all rise, yeah
But *****s don't stick to the G-code, balling on my haters
I think that I'm stuck in beast mode
Make it through the foul run to the line and make the free throw
I think that I'm D. Rose, do 'em like I'm D-Bo
Aye, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these ******* all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we ******' break a sin
Nowadays *******t's not the same
Life switch lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so
I think it's so damn strange what these people be saying
I can never even listen to a word that they say
I'm on the west side, that's the best side
By the cliff smoking blicks, that's the best high
And I got a shawty with the best eyes
Talking *******t girl, why you putting up a fight?
I'm in my own world, far from the satellites
They want my information, they get no conversation
'Cause nowadays everybody calling
I need a manager 'cause I can't really ****** with nobody (I can't
(I can't really ****** with nobody, so)
Aye, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these ******* all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we ******' break a sin

孟子：
一切结束之前
我的节奏不得迟缓
你的下一秒钟将会被我变得更加值钱
因为根本不用睡觉所以今天晚上不得失眠
你要怪你我只能怪我大脑不听使唤
do that shit 已经被征服的你
现在整个房间被我们的温度占领
你内心的所有欲望将会被我彻底唤醒
今天我会带你坠入深渊
将会深不见底 i know that shit
未来特别复杂
人与人之间的关系总是特别复杂
不能出淤泥而不染因为你也隔绝不到
如果你能回到你的从前可能你也洁白无瑕
精神恍惚以后
我加速启动
但是我没精力跟你相互许诺
我感觉此时此刻我能掌控宇宙
所以我只在意现在我没想过以后girl

Breakin records breakin curses just to show my city love
I got  all these Nikes on me you would think I had these checks
But my bank account is empty i aint agent Cody banks
******* I want all this money on me like I'm swimming in the tank
No one respecting my wave on a level that raises the bar
So I gain all this power from hate
Puffin on something exotic im obviously

Resting in bed for the next 24
Cause the weekend I had I ain't slept in a day
Possibly the best
I know that we the best

The moon will save the day(that's true)

Brothers killing brothers
While the mothers wait for silent
Quite a fight we don't remember

It's all for you at the end of the day
Girl I gave up my happiness
If it's love then I see you again
If it's not then you mess with your friends
I thought it was good 'til I came back again
Then she got a little drama with her man
Cheating on her every weekend
I get why you don't see him
But then why you can't see me
Tough you love it
Understand that it came to some
Shawty is this love
Oh, or is this pleasure
Same ways girl, it's good

It'll change when you need me
You love

All i gotta say is G*59 until the grave
1 color
2 numbers
3 fingers in the sky amongst the thunder
I'm like **** the others
Ima bring the ruckus
I might **** your bitch
She swears she suffers under the covers
Ima hell hound
Hell bound
Shawty wanna die
Ima sell pounds, sell pounds
Shawty said she might let them bells pound, bells pounds
Shawty wanna cry
I'm like **** it
Every night keep turning black
I close my eyes


Krippy Kush (Remix)-红花会
Hola
Me llamo Onika
Wrist FRIO
Pelo rosa
Culo gordo
(El Rvssian)
Lo' maliantes quieren krippy, krippy, krippy, krippy, krippy
To'a las babys quieren kush, kush, kush, kush, kush
Lo' gansters quieren krippy, krippy, krippy, krippy, krippy
To'a las babys quieren kush, kush, kush, kush, kush
Lo' maliantes quieren krippy, krippy, krippy, krippy, krippy
To'a las babys quieren kush, kush, kush, kush, kush
Lo' gansters quieren krippy, krippy, krippy, krippy, krippy
To'a las putas quieren kush... (Jajaja) (¡Yeh! ¡yeh! ¡yeh!)
Make some room, ho, keep a hundred feet away
Fifty trucks when I pull up we a fleet away
You ain’t on my throne, ain’t even a seat away
But thanks to Nicki, all these new ******* can see the way
I got the krippy, I ain't talking 'bout the gangs though
Had all these ******* rocking pink hair and bangs though
Now I got 'em rocking inches now
But I'll leave these ******* hanging like lynches now
Word play got 'em stepping up they penses now
Still stick me for my flow like syringes now
Still kicking closed doors off the hinges now
Shotgun and them '88 Benzes now
With my plug, I call him Poncho but I think he wants that chocha
Put this ******* in his boca, make my *****s take his coca
Now I'm balling like I'm Sosa in a Lamborghini rosa
Yelling "¡viva Puerto Rico!", all my ******* es hermosa
Pero ahora estoy pal' krippy, krippy, krippy, krippy, krippy
También tenemos kush, kush, kush, kush, kush
Lo' gansters quieren krippy, krippy, krippy, krippy, krippy
To'a las putas quieren kush... (Jajaja) (¡Yeh! ¡yeh! ¡yeh!)
Aquí pasamos moñas por el TSA
Las putas se montan fácil como en GTA
200 cajas 'e paper que pedí en eBay
En PR ya es legal, yo firmé la ley
Fumando como Snoop Dogg y Wiz Kha
Las gatas quieren Kush, no quieren Friska
Prendí un bastón como el de la brisca
(Farru')
2 phillies, se queda bizca
Las libras yo las compro y llegan por FedEx
Priority el paquete, next day vía express
Del celular traqueo con el GPS
Y el *******pping se lo cobramo' al bobo de tu ex
Que tiene un guille de bichote y lo que fuma es regular
Sintéticas de esas que venden por ahí en los puestos legal
Que le baja a la movie, que pa' acá no venga a frontear
Que somos millonarios
Y acabo 'e comprar par de acres pa' sembrar
Pero ahora estoy pal' krippy, krippy, krippy, krippy, krippy
También tenemos kush, kush, kush, kush, kush
Lo' gansters quieren krippy, krippy, krippy, krippy, krippy
To'a las putas quieren kush...

Switch-红花会
It's not the same anymore
Look me in my eyes and say you know me
I've been getting this on my own
Back then I drop a track and they ignore me
I'm on her snapchat story
The one I make love to is gorgeous
But I've been getting laid
I'm getting frustrated
Where was they at way back
Couches where I slept at
Never am I gon' go back
For years I had my own back
I'm still looking for some closure
They can find me on my own cause
I know I said I'd never stay sober
Maybe that's why I can't remember
They don't want to talk now
Actin' like they've done some'
Now they want to switch on me
Now they want to switch on me
I just copped my home
Now that I have grown
They don't want to switch on me
They don't want to switch on me
They don't want to talk now
Actin' like they don' something
Now they wanna switch on me
Now they wanna switch on me
I just got my home
Now that I have grown
They don't want to switch on me
They don't want to switch on me
Where was they at way back
Couches where I slept at
Never am I gon' go back
For years I had my own back
I'm still looking for closure
They can find me on my own cause
I know I said I'd never stay sober
Maybe that's why I can't remember
They don't want to talk now
Actin' like they done some'
Now they want to switch on me
Now they want to switch on me
I just copped my home
Now that I have grown
They don't want to switch on me
They don't want to switch on me
They don't want to talk now
Actin' like they don' something
Now they wanna switch on me
Now they wanna switch on me
I just got my home
Now that I have grown
They don't want to switch on me
They don't want to switch on me
Yeah
Oh yeah

Magic-红花会
Hey, I just wanna see your two nipples
Talk your language like Dr. Do Little
Boys in clubs always sayin "You’re beautiful"
And you'll be like "Come on dude, chill"
Or we can roll up a blunt and burn like the crucible
Do a line off of somebody in a cubical
I'll do almost anything, I don't say 'no' a lot
And I don't need a yacht baby to go overboard
We get drunk a lot just to make the hangover stop
It's hard to stay sober if the place is going up
And it's always going off when I step in there
Girls in sportswear, sweat me like phys-ed
I just think with my dick - I'm a dickhead
How'd if fit inside the door with my big head
I'm in my room just staring at the wall
Thinking 'bout ya'
Cos I don't believe in magic
I just believe in you
Baby there's no right answers
We're just getting through
Cos I don't believe in... Magic
Cos I don't believe in... Magic
And I'm sure your boyfriends the sweetest
But he does lack a certain me-ness
And all my ex girls say I'm the meanest
But **** those hoes that don't mean shit
Cos see i've got my own demons to beat like Peter
Parker smoking Mary-Jane reefer ****ing singers
That's why my life feels like a musical
They better play R-Kelly at my funeral
So I don't wanna rate you with a numeral
But 10 would be the number that is suitable 10
That's why I heard some handsome guy saying
"Why's she with that dude? He must be like famous?" “
And I don't mind baby, with how my fast life's changing
And I probably can't be there as much as it might pain me
And my mums car's broom-broom, and your sex drive crazy
Like Mercedes and I'm with you till the hell fires flame me
No red lights baby, and your body's gyrating
Still a teenage dirtbag listening to Iron Maiden
Yeah you're my favourite, yeah you're my favourite
Don't regret my statement, high as Empire State is
No ifs kinds or maybes, born right after the 1980's
I wanna take you to bed girl - No hibernating
Wanna message all the time just like we're dating
And we might one day, if you don't mind waiting
And I know It's kinda crazy
I never thought that it would go
This far
Go this far
And I know It's kinda crazy
I never thought that it would go
This far
Go this far (Yeah I know)
(I don't believe) （
Cos I don't believe in magic
I just believe in you
Baby there's no right answers
We're just getting through
Cos I don't believe in... Magic
